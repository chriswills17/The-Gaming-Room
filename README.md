# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that has tasked us with branching out their current Android game to be played on multiple different platforms. We were also tasked in finding appropriate hosting and implementing security measures methods.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well in attaining the differences and similarities between the different operating platforms that were under condsideration. Comparing and contrasting the various platforms helped in my understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of a given platform.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

You can almost think of it as a timeline being made as the program progresses. By looking at the design document and its sections, we can determine the best course of action for hosting and security.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I could delve more into the Domain Model of the documentation and give more detail concerning the relationships between various classes. Giving more detail means there's less chance of a misunderstanding occurring.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By finding out the core function of the game, one can then place themselves in the user's position to find the most suitable options for the user. The user will be the one interacting with the program, so it is imperative to provide them a good experience while doing so. Otherwise, they will likely cease in using the program.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

As stated before, placing one's self in the position of the user can lead to developing a better experience. As this was the first course I encountered any security implementation, this will be something technique-wise that I will use in developing future applications.
